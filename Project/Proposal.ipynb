    "      For my project, I want to create an RNN deep learning chatbot that analyzes all of my Facebook conversations and learns to talk just like me. When other people ask it questions, I want it to respond to them in the same way that I would, given my 10 years of chat history on Facebook. I want it to also answer questions in a coherent way. When asked a question, I would like it to answer with relevant information. Preferably I would want it to continue to converse with the person talking to it in a coherent way. \n",
    "\tI plan on using an encoding and decoding RNN that I will have to research into a bit before I can talk about it on a deeper level. I will be looking into some Seq2Seq model tutorials that handle conversating with RNNs for a back-end. \n",
    "\tAs far as my data goes, I plan on using all of my Facebook messages. Right now, they are downloaded in a 16gb file that contains all messages. I�ll have to make a script to parse them into easier read items, because even though they�re json, they�re not formatted super well for a deep learning tool to use. That will likely prove to be the hardest part of this project. Once I have the chat messages parsed into a good format, I�ll work on getting it functional, and then improving it through tweaks to the hyperparameters. \n",
