    "#### Question 1: \n",
    "\n",
    "While I think there may be some value to introspection, I don't believe that value can be found using the same methodologies that Wundt used. It can be helpful to know and understand how the brain stores information however measuring feelings and sensations would be mostly pointless when it comes to modeling the Human Brain, since with AI, anything we build won't actually be alive, it will simply act as if it is. \n",
    "    I do think it might be a wise decision to look at how the human brain reaches for information, analyzes situations, and processes memory. To some degree neural nets in AI are comparable to our own web of neurons. When we think of something, we can often trigger old memories which are stored in our brain like some sort of tree. When we look at an animal, we know what animal it is, because we have seen it before. Our brain traverses through the web of memories to understand what it has learned about that animal in past memories. Machine Learning must do the same with the information it has learned. This is where introspection may be valuable. Analyzing feelings, sensations, and emotions would likely be less valueable unless you believe that you can create a living thinking being with your simulation. "
