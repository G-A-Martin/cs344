b. Synthetic features allow someone to take two existing features and combine their ratio to form another feature as another column. Then you can analyze and focus your energy on the new ratio feature.

c. Outliers are unusual cases that vary by a lot from the dataset. These throw off the data and many of the interpretations that can be resolved from it. Removing them to have better data to work with is the ideal solution.
